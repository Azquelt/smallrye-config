== Config Value Properties Config Source

Creates a Config Source with `ConfigValue` support from a properties file (referenced by its URL).

The `ConfigValue` is a metadata object, containing additional information to each configuration. This includes the
Config Source origin, ordinal, or the line number from where the Config was loaded. This is useful for debugging
information.

=== Usage

This Config Source is not automatically registered. This means that need to provide your own
`ConfigSourceProvider` implementation and registration via `ServiceLoader` to use this Config Source like documented in
MicroProfile Config `ConfigSource` specification.
