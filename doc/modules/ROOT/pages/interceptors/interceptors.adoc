= Interceptors

SmallRye Config provides an interceptor chain that allows you to hook into the Configuration Value resolution. This is
useful to implement features like Property Substitution, Configuration Profiles, or just Logging to find out where
the Config was loaded from.

== Usage

You can create your interceptor by implementing the
https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config/blob/master/implementation/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/ConfigSourceInterceptor.java[ConfigSourceInterceptor]
interface.

The `ConfigSourceInterceptor` has a single method `ConfigValue getValue(ConfigSourceInterceptorContext context, String name)`
to intercept the resolution of a configuration key. You can use the `ConfigSourceInterceptorContext` to proceed with
the interceptor chain. The chain can be short-circuited by returning your instance of `ConfigValue`.

The `ConfigValue` objects hold information about the key name, value, config source origin and ordinal.

The Interceptor Chain is applied before any Conversion is performed on the Configuration.

=== Registration

You can register an interceptor in the interceptor chain by using the `ServiceLoader` mechanism and provide the
implementation classes in a `META-INF/services/io.smallrye.config.ConfigSourceInterceptor` file.

Alternatively, you can register interceptors via the Programmatic API in `SmallRyeConfigBuilder#withInterceptors`.

=== Priority

A ConfigSourceInterceptor implementation class can specify a priority by way of the standard `javax.annotation.Priority`
annotation. If no priority is explicitly assigned, the default priority value of `100` is assumed. If multiple
interceptors are registered with the same priority, then their execution order may be non-deterministic.

== Built-In Interceptors

SmallRye Config provides the following built-in Interceptors:

* <<expression-interceptor>>

[[expression-interceptor]]
=== ExpressionConfigSourceInterceptor

The `ExpressionConfigSourceInterceptor` provides expression expansion on Configuration Values. An expression string is
a mix of plain strings and expression segments, which are wrapped by the sequence `${ ... }`.

For instance, if you have the following configuration:

[source,properties]
----
my.prop=1234
expression=${my.prop}
----

Then the `expression` configuration will be resolved and expanded to the value `1234`.

Additionally, the Expression Expansion engine supports the following segments:

* `${expression:value}` - Provides a default value after the `:` if the expansion doesn't find a value.
* `${my.prop${compose}}` - Composed expressions. Inner expressions are resolved first.
* `${my.prop}${my.prop}` - Multiple expressions.

If an expression cannot be expanded and no default is supplied a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown.

The `ExpressionConfigSourceInterceptor` is not registered by default. You need to register it via the ServiceLoader
mechanism with your application.
